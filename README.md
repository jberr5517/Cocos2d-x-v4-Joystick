# Cocos2d-x v4 Joystick
Joystick For Cocos2d-x. 

I update the code so it will work for cocos2d-x v4

setMainChar writes a sprite to be controlled with the joystick. 

setSpeed() is the speed of the sprite moved with the joystick . 0.1f is set by default. 

setLimitScreen() is whether the sprite is out of the screen or not .
